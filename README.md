# 9Vsnap
snaps in to 9V battery and provides 3V3 or 5V0 output

forked from snapVCC [https://hackaday.io/project/6269-snapvcc] by [Mahesh Venkitachalam] https://hackaday.io/electronut. This version attempts to make the size of the PCB match the cross-section of the battery. I also want to use is as a demo project while doing KiCad 101
